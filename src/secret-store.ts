 *                      SecretStorage API (`app.secretStorage`, Obsidian 1.11.4+).
 *                      Never written to `data.json`, so the key never travels
 *                      with the vault (Obsidian Sync / iCloud / OneDrive).
 *   vault            - plain text inside `data.json`. The key then syncs with
 *                      the vault and is shared across devices, at the cost of
 *                      being stored in clear text.
 *
 * Everything here degrades gracefully: if SecretStorage is missing (older
 * Obsidian) the vault backend is used instead, so no key is ever lost.
